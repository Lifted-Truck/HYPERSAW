/*
 * swarm_core.h — C++ port of the SAW reference core (SwarmSynth in
 * swarmsaw.html, ADR-003). Correctness = L0-1 parity (ε = 1e-6 RMS vs the JS
 * renders), NOT plausible audio — so this is a statement-by-statement
 * transcription, and every deviation from the obvious C++ idiom below is
 * load-bearing:
 *
 * - All state is double (JS numbers are f64); output buffers are float with
 *   read-modify-write rounding per store, because the reference accumulates
 *   into a Float32Array (each += rounds to f32 — skipping that rounding is
 *   an audible-in-the-oracle divergence).
 * - The RNG reproduces mulberry32 under JS int semantics: |0 (ToInt32),
 *   Math.imul (low-32 multiply), >>> (uint32 shift). uint32_t arithmetic is
 *   bit-identical to all of these.
 * - Expression shapes match the reference (e.g. sigma floor before use,
 *   couple computed from the PREVIOUS tick's phases, per-swarm local `tick`
 *   counter with the shared counter advanced once per render call).
 * - Header-only, pure, allocation-free after construction, no wall-clock
 *   (SPEC §5.7); tools and the plugin both include it.
 *
 * Known parity caveat (measured, not assumed): V8's transcendentals are
 * fdlibm-based and may differ from libm by ULPs; chaotic regimes can amplify
 * that. The parity harness reports per-scenario RMS so any such divergence
 * is visible and attributable.
