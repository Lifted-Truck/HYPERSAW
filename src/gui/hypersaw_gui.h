/*
 * hypersaw_gui.h — the GUI seam (ADR-019 ratification amendment).
 *
 * This header is the ONLY thing the plugin shell knows about the GUI, and it
 * contains no webview, platform, or CLAP types. Swapping the webview for a
 * native backend (iPlug2/ImGui, the recorded fallback) means reimplementing
 * hypersaw_gui.mm against this same interface — nothing else moves.
 *
 * - VizSnapshot: plain-struct visualization feed, engine -> GUI.
 * - GuiHost: transport-agnostic callbacks, GUI -> engine (param sets are
 *   QUEUED by the shell onto the audio thread, never applied directly).
