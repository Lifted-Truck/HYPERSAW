/*
 * routing_core.h — the B23 crosspoint routing matrix (ADR-088), framework-free.
 *
 * A slot may be fed from any SOURCE and from any EARLIER slot. Each crosspoint
 * carries a continuous coefficient; each slot carries an INITIAL VALUE, so
 * `out_i = in_i + Σ g_ki · m_k` — the canonical crosspoint form (Brandtsegg,
 * Saue & Johansen, NIME 2011), which the routing lab's scheme C lacked until
 * the amendment.
 *
 * WHY DENSE AND NOT A SPARSE EDGE LIST. Quantum morph interpolates VALUES, and
 * in a dense table a coefficient of 0 *is* "not connected" — so connecting and
 * disconnecting are one continuous motion. Every sparse representation stores
 * topology as discrete structure, making an edge add/remove a hard cut. That is
 * what decided ADR-088; the cost argument (88 patch-state values, 8 automation
 * ids) merely failed to disqualify it.
 *
 * ACYCLICITY IS ENFORCED ON THE READ SIDE, ALWAYS. A slot may only read
 * strictly earlier slots, so one forward pass is always correct and no runtime
 * cycle detection is needed — an audio thread cannot afford it. The legality
 * test lives in `edgeLive()` and every consumer calls it: the signal sum, the
 * output sum, the terminal test and any renderer of the graph. It is NOT
 * enforced at the editor, because the writer set is open — preset load, morph
 * corners and automation all write topology, so a guard on the write path is
 * bypassable by construction. (The routing lab proved this the expensive way:
 * a guard in the select handler let a backwards edge through when set directly
 * on the model, and a second copy of the "is this slot consumed?" logic that
 * skipped the check silently removed a slot from the output.)
 *
 * FX-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION. This owns the topology and nothing else — the
 * caller supplies slot processing through a callable. That keeps the matrix
 * testable against a trivial stand-in slot (so the oracle measures ROUTING and
 * never an effect), and it is the shape that transfers: a routing facility that
 * names an effect type is not a routing facility.

     are live" or "which slot is an output" — that duplication is the bug the
     header note describes, and re-deriving it against real audio is where it
     would be least visible.

     Scratch is CALLER-OWNED (`slotL/slotR`, NSLOT buffers of >= n): the audio
     thread allocates nothing. `proc(slot, L, R, n)` transforms a slot's buffer
     IN PLACE, which is also what makes an Off slot a bit-exact passthrough —
     it simply does not touch the gathered input.

     `outL/outR` may alias a source buffer (the shell passes the mix bus as both
     source and destination). Safe because the output is not written until every
     slot has gathered; keep that ordering if this is ever restructured. */
