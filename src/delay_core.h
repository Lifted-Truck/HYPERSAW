/*
 * delay_core.h — the STANDARD stereo delay (B68/B73 increment A, ADR-142).
 *
 * THIS CORE HAS NO HTML LAB, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Every other core here is
 * a port of a prototype (ADR-003 spec-in-code), and correctness means parity
 * with that prototype. There is no delay lab, and writing one first would
 * reproduce the exact thing the human rejected: `swarmtime.html`'s feedback
 * law is what "didn't really work very well". So this file IS the spec, and
 * its oracle is `tools/delay_check.cpp` — impulse-response invariants
 * (spacing, per-generation ratio, boundedness, ping-pong alternation, sync
 * arithmetic) rather than sample-parity against a reference that would only
 * enshrine the defect. B73's roadmap entry is the standing license to diverge.
 *
 * WHY THE SWARM DELAY NEEDED A SIBLING (measured in src/time_core.h):
 *   - `fbSig = wetRaw / n` is ADR-031's worst-case-correlation norm. With the
 *     default 8 taps the audible loop gain at regen 0.9 is ~0.32: repeats die
 *     in two or three generations and the edge-of-oscillation zone — the
 *     musical heart of a delay — is unreachable at any knob setting.
 *   - Every tap averages into ONE write head, so each generation re-smears
 *     through the whole swarm. That is a wash, not a repeat.
 *   - `tanh` sits at unity in the loop and damping is always in circuit, so
 *     every pass ducks and dulls even when the patch asked for neither.
 * This core answers each: single-tap-per-channel feedback (loop gain IS the
 * knob), saturation only above a threshold, damping still in-loop because
 * that is what a delay's repeats are supposed to do — but a gentle one-pole
 * whose cutoff the player owns.
 *
 * REAL-TIME CONTRACT: buffers are preallocated at construct; processStereo()
 * allocates nothing, reads no clock, and calls nothing external. Seeded RNG
 * is not merely absent but unnecessary — there is no stochastic element here,
 * which is why this module carries none of the unseeded-RNG blocker that
 * parks CANTO/WARP/STATION.
