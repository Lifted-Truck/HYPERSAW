/*
 * glide_core.h — the travel laws (A1 fold, ratified 2026-08-06), transcribed
 * VERBATIM from bend-lab.html's Inertia class. Pitch does not arrive where you
 * point it, it TRAVELS there, and "how long does a glide take" has more than
 * one honest answer:
 *
 *   1 constant time  — same duration near or far (velocity set by distance)
 *   2 constant rate  — fixed cents/second, so distance sets the duration  [DEFAULT]
 *   3 lag            — one-pole, asymptotic, never technically arrives
 *   4 spring         — true inertia: overshoots and rings
 *
 * Law 5 of the prototype (lag -> constant rate) is CUT by the fold ruling: it
 * measured as the closest pair to law 3 (every headline metric identical, peak
 * divergence 8.70 cents) and added a control without adding a behaviour. Its
 * `case 5` is deliberately absent rather than dead-coded.
 *
 * SCALE QUANTISE is a MODIFIER, not a fifth law: it snaps the EMITTED pitch
 * while the law's dynamics run untouched underneath, so it composes with all
 * four (spring + quantise = an overshooting autotune wobble).
 *
 * Parity-exactness rules (as swarm_core.h): doubles for state, control rate =
 * sr/16, no wall-clock. Correctness = trajectory parity vs the JS reference
 * (tools/glide_check.cpp) — never "plausible-feeling glide".
 *
 * NOT YET WIRED INTO THE AUDIO PATH. Core + oracle first, shell integration
 * behind its own increment — the same order the swarmalator port used.
