/* steal_check — WHICH voice dies when the pool is full.
 *
 * FOUNDATIONS asked (seam brief question 1) whether oldest-logical is an
 * acceptable steal rule at kPoly=16. Answering it exposed that NOTHING here
 * pinned steal priority at all: `notefuzz_check` proves no voice HANGS, and it
 * proves that whether the victim is the oldest, the newest, or picked at
 * random. A seam that changed steal order would have left all sixteen gates
 * green. This is that gap.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED — the three tiers of `alloc()` (swarm_core.h), in priority
 * order, stated as behaviour rather than as code:
 *   1. a FREE slot is used before anything is stolen;
 *   2. a RELEASING tail is taken before any held note is;
 *   3. only when every slot is gated does the OLDEST held note die.
 * Tier 3 is the one that must agree with a logical-steal rule. Tiers 1-2 read
 * envelope state and are engine-private — they are pinned here as behaviour so
 * that a library seam cannot silently override them from the outside.
 *
 * FREQUENCY LAYOUT IS LOAD-BEARING (L0032). Every measured note lives within a
 * SINGLE OCTAVE (MIDI 60..71), so no measured fundamental can be a harmonic of
 * another measured note — a harmonic is at least 2x, which is outside the
 * octave by construction. The mixer_check probe reported mute as 67% broken
 * because it separated two oscillators by an octave and read one's 2nd harmonic
 * as the other's fundamental; the fix there was a tritone, and the general form
 * is this: choose the layout so the contamination is IMPOSSIBLE, not unlikely.
 * Notes 72..75 exist to fill the pool and are deliberately NOT measured — 72 is
 * exactly one octave above 60 and would read 60's second harmonic.
