"""gen_gui_controls — build gui2's missing controls FROM the presentation table.

This is the whole point of FOUNDATIONS' D1 ruling made operational: GUI structure
is DERIVED from declarations, not hand-placed. Adding a parameter becomes adding
a row, and a control can no longer be forgotten — the 29-dead-controls failure
and the 75-missing-controls gap are the same defect from opposite sides, and both
are unreachable once the markup is generated.

WHERE EACH FIELD COMES FROM, because the split is the design:

  * `src/param_presentation.tsv` — label, page, group, widget, unit. OURS.
    Address-keyed, no id column (their D1 caution: a page name that is also a
    dispatch fact re-fuses what the criterion separates).
  * `src/hypersaw_clap.cpp` — id, min, max, default, stepped, enum labels. The
    STRUCTURE half, which becomes ParamDesc at re-point.
  * `tools/gui_reach.py` — which ids are patch-scope and therefore need
    `data-fixed`. **Executed, not re-implemented.** That derivation has two
    semantic anchors and took three wrong versions to settle; a second copy here
    is how two copies disagree later. gui_reach owns it, we consume it.

The numeric id appears in the GENERATED markup because CLAP speaks ids — but it
enters at generation time, by joining an address-keyed table against the shell.
Nothing a human authors carries an id. That is the invariant worth protecting.

IDEMPOTENT: rewrites only between the GEN markers, so running it twice is a
no-op and hand-written controls are never touched.
