"""presentation_check — the presentation table is TOTAL, address-keyed, and honest.

WHAT THIS GATES, and why each part exists:

1. TOTALITY. Every parameter the shell declares has exactly one presentation row,
   and the table has no rows for parameters that do not exist. A GUI generated
   from a partial table silently omits controls — which is the 29-dead-controls
   failure with the arrow reversed, and no audio oracle can see either.

2. ADDRESS-KEYED, STRUCTURALLY. The table must have NO `id` column. FOUNDATIONS'
   D1 caution, adopted verbatim: "do not let the presentation table key on
   anything but the address — a page/group name that is also a dispatch fact is
   how the two get fused again." A rule enforced by the absence of a column
   cannot be violated by a careless row, which is why it is checked here as a
   header property rather than trusted as a convention.

3. SCOPE AGREES WITH THE ADDRESS. `scope` is not independent data — it IS the
   address prefix (their D2: scopes are named by address prefix, never by an
   enumerated type). Checking it means the column can never drift into a second,
   disagreeing vocabulary.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT GATE: patch-scope. It is dispatch, not
presentation, and `tools/gui_reach.py` already derives it from the shell with two
semantic anchors that took three wrong versions to settle. A second copy here
would be a second copy of the rule.

GAPS ARE COUNTED, NOT HIDDEN. Rows still at page=TODO or group=(ungrouped) are
reported every run. A table that is 97% filled should say so; silence would read
as complete.

    Echo and Room while the GUI kept offering seven options, so two slot types

    throughout, and correctly: param 57 IS reachable -- it simply cannot reach
