"""test_table_check — the feature test table cannot claim coverage it lacks.

A table of tests is a claim about what is verified, and a claim about coverage is
exactly the kind that rots invisibly: a row naming an oracle nobody wrote reads as
green forever, and a feature with no row at all reads as nothing to test. Both
failures are silent by construction, which is why they are gated rather than
reviewed.

WHAT IS CHECKED:

1. EVERY NAMED ORACLE EXISTS. An agentic row's `oracle` must be a gate `./verify`
   actually invokes — parsed from `verify`, never a hardcoded list, so a renamed
   gate fails here the day it is renamed rather than the day someone notices the
   row was fiction. `none` and `manual` are legal and mean what they say.

2. EVERY (page, feature) IN THE GUI HAS AT LEAST ONE ROW. The feature axis is
   taken from `src/param_presentation.tsv` — the same table the GUI is generated
   from — so a feature cannot appear on screen with no test row. `*` rows are
   cross-cutting and satisfy nothing specific on purpose.

3. THE CLASSIFICATION IS PRESENT AND LEGAL. `pins` is RULING or ENCODING, and
   nothing else. FOUNDATIONS' R8 is why: they asserted their own encoding as
   though it were the rule and failed a conforming consumer against it. A row
   that cannot say which it is has not been thought about.

4. A RULING NAMES ITS OWNER. `owner` must be non-empty for a RULING — an ADR, a
   FOUNDATIONS ruling, `spec`, or `human`. A decision nobody owns cannot be
   revisited, only argued about.

GAPS ARE COUNTED, NEVER HIDDEN: rows with `oracle=none` are printed every run.
That number going UP is fine — it means we found something we cannot yet test.
It reading zero when it should not is the failure this gate exists to prevent.
