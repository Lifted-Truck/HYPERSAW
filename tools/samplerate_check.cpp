/* samplerate_check — behaviour expressed in SECONDS must not track the sample
 * rate. ADR-009 requires every slew and time constant to be declared in seconds
 * and converted to a coefficient, and bans hand-tuned per-tick constants.
 * Nothing enforced it until this file; the charter said it and the code was
 * trusted, which is exactly the shape "the audio thread must not allocate" had
 * before rtsafety_probe existed.
 *
 * IT HAS ALREADY EARNED ITS PLACE. Written the same hour ADR-086 shipped, it
 * found a defect in that fix: `kGravGrid = 256` was a fixed SAMPLE COUNT, so
 * the grid's duration shrank as the rate rose (5.81 ms at 44.1 k, 2.67 ms at
 * 96 k) and gravity's settle time drifted +0.42% at 96 kHz, monotonically. The
 * fix had removed a dependence on buffer size and left one on sample rate. No
 * golden could ever have seen it — goldens are generated at 44.1 kHz only, so
 * parity is silent about every other rate (L0031).
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT'S OWN RESOLUTION MUST NOT TRACK THE VARIABLE UNDER TEST.
 * The first version stepped in 256-SAMPLE blocks, so its time resolution was
 * 5.8 ms at 44.1 k and 2.7 ms at 96 k — and it manufactured a 1.4% attack
 * variation that vanished to ±0.13% once the step was one MILLISECOND at every
 * rate with interpolated threshold crossings. A probe whose resolution depends
 * on the thing it is testing will report the effect it is looking for (L0032).
