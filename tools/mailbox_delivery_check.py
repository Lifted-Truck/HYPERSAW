"""mailbox_delivery_check — did our outbound filings actually REACH the reader?

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-15 we hit three versions of one failure in a single
day: a filing left uncommitted, a filing committed to a side branch, and a filing
committed inside a sibling's checkout and never pushed. The last one stranded an
ack FOUNDATIONS was actively waiting on for seven hours. Every version was
SILENT FROM BOTH ENDS -- we saw a commit, they saw nothing, and neither side had
a signal. Their own outbox sweep reported "awaiting HYPERSAW" correctly the whole
time: the sweep was right and the world was wrong, because a file absent from
their `origin` is indistinguishable from a file never written.

Care does not fix a failure with no feedback. This is the feedback.

WHAT IT CHECKS. For every sibling mailbox `../<SIBLING>/integrations/hypersaw/`,
every file whose front matter says `from: HYPERSAW` must exist at that sibling's
`origin/main`. Anything else is a draft that looks like a filing to its author.
That is the amended rule (their R9, our proposal, adopted verbatim):

    A filing is FILED when it is PUSHED to the correspondent's origin/main.

NO MACHINE PATHS. Siblings are discovered repo-relative (`../*/integrations/
hypersaw`), never from an absolute path or an env var holding one -- committing
either would bake this machine's layout into a public repo. Where no sibling
checkout exists, there is nothing to check and the gate says so rather than
implying it verified something.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it never writes to a sibling. Writes stay home;
this only reads. Fixing a stranded filing is a human-visible act, so it reports
and exits non-zero rather than quietly pushing on someone's behalf.
