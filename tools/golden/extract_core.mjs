/*
 * extract_core.mjs — load a prototype's headless DSP core WITHOUT forking it.
 *
 * The prototype HTMLs are the reference implementation (ADR-003) and are
 * protected paths; a copied-out core would silently diverge the first time
 * the reference updates (the file-drop lesson, LIBRARY L0001). So the golden
 * generator evals the DSP section straight out of the HTML at run time.
 *
 * Extraction is marker-based, not line-based: every prototype delimits its
 * core with banner comments —
 *     /* ================= DSP: ... =================
 *     ... constants + core class ...
 *     /* ================= Audio graph =================
 * Line numbers drift across reference updates; the banners have been stable
 * across v1→v2 of two prototypes. If a banner disappears, fail loudly.
