"""Emit the DECLARATION side of the conformance dump: id, key, global.

Deliberately separate from registry_dump.cpp, which emits patch_key from the
bytes state_save writes. Two independent sources is the whole point — deriving
`key` from `patch_key` (the obvious shortcut) would make FOUNDATIONS' C4 compare
a reconstruction against a string built from the same source.

STRIP COMMENTS BEFORE PARSING IDS. The first version ran \\d+ over the raw
kGlobalIds block and slurped digits out of "A12", "ADR-082" and "2026-08-11",
reporting 36 globals where there are 29 — which marked `dist` both global and
per-oscillator. registry_conformance caught it as C2 "leaf shadows an ancestor",
correctly, on real data. That was a free calibration of their tool and a real
defect in ours.
