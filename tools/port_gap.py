"""port_gap — which reference parameters never reached their C++ port?

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three unported reference behaviours surfaced in two days, each
found by the human playing the plugin rather than by anything we ran: the plain
pitch wheel (ADR-096 aftermath), the quantiser's `qTime` step gate, and per-note
MPE bend inertia (ADR-097). They share a shape — the reference had it, a gate
covered the NEIGHBOURING case, and nothing ever asked whether this one was
covered at all.

Parity cannot ask that question. Parity certifies agreement over the surface the
reference RENDERS with the settings a golden happens to use (LIBRARY L0031); a
parameter the goldens never move is invisible to it, and a parameter the port
never DECLARED is invisible twice over.

WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. It is a lexical diff of parameter NAMES: the keys of a
lab's defaults object against the fields its C++ core declares. That makes it a
lead generator, not an oracle — a name present in both proves nothing about
behaviour, and a name missing from the port may be a deliberate omission (lab
bench furniture, a display-only meter). Every hit needs a human read. It is
therefore NOT wired into ./verify: a check whose output is "go look at these"
cannot be a pass/fail gate without inviting a rubber stamp.

# UNION EVERY CANDIDATE BLOCK. Two heuristics were tried and both produced a

#   1. "longest object literal" picked swarmalator's CSS-in-JS style block, so
#      that lab was compared on `background, border, color` and its engine
#      parameters were never looked at.
#   2. "first `this.p =`" picked bend-lab's DEMO OSCILLATOR defaults, not its
#      travel-law defaults — proven by planting the pre-2026-08-20 port (qTime
#      deleted) and watching the scan report the same five names as before.
# Selecting ONE block means betting on which block matters, and a wrong bet is
# silent. So take every literal that looks like defaults and union the keys:
# over-collection is visible (a name appears and someone reads it) whereas
# under-collection is not.
