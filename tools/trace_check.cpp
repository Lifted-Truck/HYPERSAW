/* trace_check — the forensic note trace (FOUNDATIONS brief ask (c)).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The stuck-note bug survived weeks because it could
 * not be REPRODUCED, and no generator was ever going to reproduce it: a fuzzer
 * emits the event stream it IMAGINES, and ours deliberately excludes shapes no
 * host can produce (notefuzz_check.cpp:14-17). It can therefore never model a
 * stream the host actually delivered. Capture beats simulate — a field report
 * becomes a replayable regression case instead of an anecdote.
 *
 * WHY IT DRIVES THE REAL PLUGIN. The dump is triggered through the same code
 * path the GUI panic button uses, via a test hook, rather than by rebuilding
 * the ring in the test. A test that reimplements the mechanism it checks spans
 * the wrong layer and would pass against a capture path that was never wired
 * (L0031-B3: a fidelity result about the wrong surface is not evidence).
 *
 * EVERY ASSERTION HAS A MUST-READ-NOTHING CONTROL (L0032). A dump is a text
 * file full of plausible-looking lines; "the key is in the file" is satisfied
 * by a file that mentions every key. So each positive assertion is paired with
 * a negative one that must NOT match, on a dump taken from a state where the
 * thing genuinely is absent.
