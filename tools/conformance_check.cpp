/* conformance_check — FOUNDATIONS' note-lifecycle conformance suite, run
 * against OUR bookkeeping.  (Their R5 / DECISIONS #80; our ROADMAP entry
 * "FOUNDATIONS — fleet protocol acked; conformance run BLOCKED on repo
 * visibility".)
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS TRACKED AND THEIR HEADERS ARE NOT. HYPERSAW is a PUBLIC
 * repo; FOUNDATIONS is PRIVATE. Committing `note.h` / `note_conformance.h`
 * would publish a private sibling's source, so they are vendored to a
 * gitignored path (libs/vendor/foundations/, human ruling 2026-08-15) and this
 * whole target disappears when they are absent. The adapter below is ours and
 * carries all of the risk, so it is public. The consequence is stated rather
 * than hidden: public CI will never have their headers, so `./verify` reports
 * this gate as SKIPPED there — a locally-run measurement, not a CI block.
 *
 * WHAT IS UNDER TEST, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT. The suite drives an adapter
 * over the consumer's own note bookkeeping. Ours is not a library type: identity
 * lives in the shell (`Plugin::tags[kPoly]`, hypersaw_clap.cpp) and the STEAL
 * POLICY lives in the engine (`swarm_core.h::alloc()`, ADR-083's three tiers),
 * because the tiers read envelope state the shell cannot see. So the adapter
 * spans both — and it must NOT bridge them by recomputing anything:
 *
 *   - notes arrive as REAL CLAP events through the REAL process() path;
 *   - a steal is observed as the NOTE_END the plugin emits to the host, which
 *     is precisely what a host sees, not a prediction of what it should emit;
 *   - `end()` calls the shipped `retireTag()`, the same function a steal and a
 *     mono retarget call.
 *
 * An adapter that computed "who should have been stolen" would be an oracle
 * checking its own copy of the rule under test (L0031, and the shape L0032
 * names): it would agree with the engine by construction and certify nothing.
 *
 * CALIBRATION LIVES IN ./verify, NOT HERE. A suite that has never rejected
 * anything is not a gate (their words and ours). The planted-defect run is
 * recorded in the trace for this change.
