"""gui_reach — every declared param must be REACHABLE in at least one shipped GUI.

L0023, third occurrence and the one that finally became a gate. The lesson says
a parameter range widened without its UI control ships a feature that is fully
implemented, fully tested, host-automatable, and absent from the product — and
that NO audio oracle can see it, because the audio path is correct. It has now
cost: FX types 0..5 shipping with dropdowns offering 0..3 for two weeks; a panic
button that existed everywhere except the interface that ships; and the discovery
(2026-08-12) that gui2 reaches 18 of 105 params while being someone's daily
driver.

Prose did not prevent any of those. This is the enforcement.

WHAT IS GATED: a param unreachable in EVERY GUI is a build failure. That is the
original bug and it is unambiguous.

WHAT IS REPORTED, NOT GATED: per-GUI coverage. gui2 is an in-progress renovation
and failing the build over its gaps would block all work — but the number is
printed on every run so the gap cannot be forgotten again, which is precisely how
it got this far. A number nobody sees is prose with extra steps.

# ---- PATCH-SCOPE PINNING -------------------------------------------------
# Some params are dispatched by RAW id in the shell (`id == 43`,
# `id >= 57 && id <= 64`, …) rather than by base id, because they address ONE
# shared object — the FX rack, the SPECTRA engine, the engine selector — not a
# per-oscillator core. A GUI control for one of those MUST carry data-fixed, or
# `effId()` remaps it (57 -> 1057) when a non-first oscillator is selected, it
# matches no dispatch branch, and the control silently does nothing.
#
# Found 2026-08-12 while adding the gui2 FX page: gui.html had 29 such controls
# unpinned, so selecting oscillator 2 killed the whole FX rack, the whole SPECTRA
# surface and the engine selector — with every oracle green, because the audio
# path is correct and the events simply never arrive. L0028's role-vs-instance
# shape, reached through the GUI rather than the event loop.

# covered the day it is written rather than the day someone remembers this.
