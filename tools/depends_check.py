"""depends_check -- the feature-dependency graph must stay honest (ADR-108).

WHY. Three systems used to answer "does this parameter matter right now?"
independently: shown_when (GUI), the morph field (which happily flipped a
parameter whose enabling law was off), and the engine's own guards, which are
the truth the other two approximated. `depends` is now the single declaration
that feeds the first two. This gate defends the third relationship -- the one
no generator can enforce -- by checking the declaration against the code.

WHAT IT CHECKS.
  1. STRUCTURE: every clause names a parameter the shell declares, and a value
     inside that parameter's range. A typo'd key silently means "always live",
     which is the failure mode this class of table has every time.
  2. GENERATION: the generated header is current. A stale depends_graph.h means
     the morph hierarchy is running on a graph nobody can see.
  3. DRIFT (advisory, printed not failed): parameters the ENGINE guards behind a
     mode check but the table does not describe. Advisory because a guard is not
     always a dependency -- `sawBase > 0.001` is a magnitude test, not a mode --
     and turning judgement into a hard gate is how exemption lists start.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK. Whether a declared dependency is CORRECT. Nothing here
can know that `harmReach` belongs to law 4 except by reading the branch that
uses it, which is a human act. The gate keeps the declaration well-formed and
current; it does not pretend to keep it true.
