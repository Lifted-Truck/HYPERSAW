/*
 * modlab_sweep.mjs — exhaustive deterministic sweep of EVERY mod routing in
 * docs/design/mod-lab.html.
 *
 * WHY: the 2026-08-05 chorus crash was a single (source, destination) pair
 * reaching a floating-point edge no one would think to test by hand. The whole
 * matrix is only 12 x 9; there is no excuse for sampling it. Every routing is
 * driven at full depth, both polarities, from a FRESH engine, and checked for:
 *
 *   NON-FINITE  a NaN/Inf anywhere in the output      -> hard failure
 *   HOT         peak far above the unmodulated level  -> level blow-up
 *   DEAD        output bit-identical to depth 0       -> the routing does nothing
 *
 * DEAD is included deliberately: a control that silently does nothing is the
 * same failure class as the FX dropdown that shipped Comb unreachable — no
 * oracle sees it, because nothing is wrong with the audio.
 *
 * Deterministic: fixed seeds, fixed note, fresh ModLab per trial, no wall clock.
 * Usage: node tools/labharness/modlab_sweep.mjs [--blocks N]

/*
 * CALIBRATING THE DETECTOR. A routing reads "dead" for two very different
 * reasons, and conflating them makes the whole sweep useless:
 *   (a) the routing is broken                    -> a finding
 *   (b) its target was switched off in the bench -> my fault, not the lab's
 * The first run of this sweep reported 53 dead routings and every one was (b).
 * So the bench is now configured so each destination has somewhere to GO:
 *   - rotor n = MAXK, or K5..K8 are hard-zeroed sources (the lab's own UI
 *     hides those rows, so they are correct-by-design, not dead controls)
 *   - chorus/phaser mix > 0, or choDep/phDep act on nothing
 *   - cutoff parked mid-range, or a positive cutoff mod clamps instantly
 *   - one corner-scoped routing present, or morphX/morphY are inert BY
 *     DESIGN: in this lab morph position only gates scope, it does not blend
 *     corner parameters, so with every scope system-wide there is nothing
 *     for a morph move to change.
