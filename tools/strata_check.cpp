/*
 * strata_check — STRATA's six properties, as the spec states them (B77).
 *
 * The human's own acceptance list (STRATA-integration-spec.md §2.2/§10) is
 * the contract; this file is that list executed. Sweep-based rather than
 * example-based, because every one of these is a claim about ALL (v, u), and
 * an example test would pass on a combinator that is right in the middle and
 * wrong at the rails — which is precisely where a macro layer lives.
 *
 *   P1 neutrality   u = 0 is an EXACT passthrough at every tier
 *   P2 totality     at depth 1, u = +/-1 pins the output to the rail
 *   P3 boundedness  cascade stays in [0,1] with no clamp invoked
 *   P4 agency       monotone in v and u; agency reaches zero ONLY at |u| = 1
 *   P5 continuity   continuous across the u = 0 hinge
 *   P6 composition  same-sign contributions commute, mixed-sign ones do not,
 *                   and both match the closed forms the spec gives
